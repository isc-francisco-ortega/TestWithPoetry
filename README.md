# Petco Android Mobile Tech Test

**Hi Candidate,**  
Welcome to our Android mobile technical test, called _TestWithPoetry_. At Petco, we’ll use this test to evaluate your skills.
In order to evaluated what you have done, you may folk this project and upload your changes in your personal github account.
Best of luck—we believe in you!

# General info
This trial should be build in compose views.

# Instructions
**We’ve already set up something for you.**  We’ve implemented common tools that we use in our daily work in this project. However, feel free to modify any file if is necessary to complete the test, remember in this test you should show all clean architecture and SOLID principles that you know. Be aware project can contain some bugs if you can solve it will be great.

TestWithPoetry already have:
- Ktor
- Dagger hilt
- Room
- Compose
- Compose Navigation
- Serialization

You will have 24 hours to finish this test. Afterward, we’ll have a one-hour meeting where our Android team will ask technical questions for the first 25 minutes. The rest of the meeting will be dedicated to reviewing the code, during which our Android leads will ask questions about what you’ve done.

### Restrictions

You can use any tools from the internet, with one restriction: you cannot use Artificial Intelligence or seek help from other developers. We want to understand how you code, so the code should be entirely yours.
